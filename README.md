*- by Auric Dutt*
## 📘 Overview
This project is a **Machine Learning-based Heart Disease Prediction System** that helps identify whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on medical attributes such as age, cholesterol level, and blood pressure.  
It is deployed as an interactive **Streamlit Web App** that allows users to visualize data, explore model performance, and make live predictions.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection can save lives by enabling timely treatment and lifestyle changes.  
This project aims to build a model that predicts the likelihood of heart disease using patient data, making early diagnosis more accessible and data-driven.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
A **Logistic Regression model** was trained on a heart disease dataset.  
The system preprocesses user input, applies the trained model, and displays prediction results with confidence scores and visual insights for better interpretability.
